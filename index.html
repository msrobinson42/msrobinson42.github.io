                    My name is Zach Robinson. I am a soon to be graduate from Southeast Technical College with an associate degree in Computer Programming.
                    I graduated from Roosevelt High School in 2009, and went to South Dakota State University to pursue a bachelor's degree in graphic design.
                    I found success both from a creative standpoint as well as cementing myself as a leader among my peers. I had the opportunity to 
                    intern at Daktronics' Animation department and learned a wealth of information about video processing and design in 3d. Although the 
                    experience was incredibly rewarding, ultimately I felt graphic design did not suit my personal strengths and left the university in 2013.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked at Shred-it, a document destruction company, for a few years before coming to a realization that my personal strengths of 
                    critical thinking, ambition, curiosity, and a dedicated focus on efficiency could more fully be satisfied if I pursued an alternate career path.
                    After some deliberation, I decided to pursue an associate degree of Computer Programming.

                    Having not programmed in any capacity before my first semester at Southeast Technical College in Fall of 2019, I was hooked from the first
                    day. My appetite for knowledge quickly outpaced the knowledge enveloped by the requirements of the curriculum, and I sought and strove to 
                    learn as much as I could on my own. Through help and connections of the faculty, I found a professional who became both my mentor and friend.
                    He helped me push myself and guided me as I learned and absorbed as much information as I could. I am still just as hungry as ever; programming
                    is an incredible field with limitless opportunities for growth. I would be thrilled to speak with you about my experiences at STC, or about
                    programming in general!
