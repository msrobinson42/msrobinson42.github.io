				<p>
					I began this project in the fall of 2019, a few weeks into my first
					semester at Southeast Technical Institute.<br />
					I consume a Web API from Riot Games and use their data to draw
					conclusions about the performance of players in an online game. The
					player can use this information to analyze their performance and make
					adjustments to improve.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
                    I saw that the values of the JSON at the Riot Games Developer endpoints were largely just simple primitive types that I had been taught in class.
                    I knew that I could use those primitives to draw interesting conclusions. If I could get access to this data, I could implement methods
                    that could take in any number of those parameters and output useful and unique data to other similar websites/services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To my dismay, consuming an API was a lot more difficult than manipulating the values once I had brought them in to my program.
                    Fortunately, through a professor at Southeast Tech, I met a friend who took it upon himself to help mentor me. This has proven invaluable in my
                    growth as a programmer. With his help, we casted off my ignorance and gained fundamental knowledge about syntactical standards and application architecture.
                    With my newfound knowledge, I created an application that consumes the Riot Games API asynchronously and uses LINQ to filter through the data and display 
                    information about a particular player (given as input).

					The first project in a class that simulates an Agile work environment
					with 4-week sprints.<br />
					This project aimed to create a large and extensible image processing
					application. This application should also follow recommendations
					described by SOLID Principles of Object Oriented Design and specific
					design patterns to ensure the promised extensibility.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
                    For this assignment, I wanted to explore creating an application using the SOLID principles of object-oriented design and some design patterns
                    I had been reading about. It was a good chance to put into practice a lot of theory that still felt a bit abstract in my mind. Another goal of 
                    mine was to make the project easily maintainable and extensible so that my partner would be able to implement any additional filters or
                    image processing algorithms with minimal effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a lot of trial and error in this project. Using Command Pattern to encapsulate each individual image manipulation allowed for trivial implementation
                    of Undo functionality, but trying to implement Factory Method Pattern to maintain dependency injection and Open/Closed ended up in a class explosion. In the end,
                    I reached out to a community of developers. After hearing their opinion and doing some research, I decided using a State Machine type class to hold the
                    state of the image was a better solution. The class explosion was pruned, and Open/Closed Principle was maintained through use of extension methods for 
                    the implementation of the manipulations. The project was a huge success in pushing my knowledge of how to architect a larger scale application.
